## Flow-eda-oauth2

## Brief

> #### A low-code programming application based on event-driven principles, utilizing a visual programming approach to draw processes by dragging and connecting nodes, thereby enabling business programming through the composition of these nodes.

## Functions

- ### Operation flow

  > #### Each 「nodeType」 has a specified set of 「nodeTypeParams」, which can be entered by the user. By combining a series of 「nodeTypes」, a 「nodedata」 is generated, which is used to determine the transaction flow. 

- ### Authentication and authentication

  > #### JwtToken-based back-end authentication, form authentication and OAuth2-based third-party authentication have been introduced.

## Module

- 

## Feature

- #### The entire process running engine is implemented at the back end, and the front end is very lightweight.  

- #### Multithreaded processing, parallel and serial processes are supported.

- #### The modular and configured process running engine makes it easy to implement extension and development of capabilities.

- #### The back-end design adopts microservice architecture, and each module is decoupled from each other according to business functions, which makes it convenient for secondary development and function expansion.
